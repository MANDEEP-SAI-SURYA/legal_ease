I wanted to discuss the fee structure for my case. I've been quite proactive in preparing the groundwork:

• Completed {work_percentage:.1f}% of preliminary work through our legal platform
• Analyzed and organized all relevant documents  
• Prepared comprehensive case timeline and deadlines
• Conducted initial legal research

Given this substantial preparation, I believe a fee adjustment reflecting the work already completed would be fair. Would you be open to discussing a rate that accounts for these efforts?

Best regards"""
